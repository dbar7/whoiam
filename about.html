                    <p>Hello! My name is Diego, and this website is my personal space on the internet. I am passionate about technology, design, and exploring the web.</p>
                    <p>Here, you'll find a collection of my thoughts, projects, and things I find interesting. I was heavily inspired by the optimistic and clean aesthetic of the mid-2000s, and I wanted to recreate that feeling here.</p>

                    <p>This website is a tribute to the <strong>Frutiger Aero</strong> design style, which was popular from roughly 2004 to 2013. It's known for its glossy textures, skeuomorphic details, and heavy use of nature imagery.</p>
                    <p>The goal was to create a corner of the web that feels bright, optimistic, and human-centric, as a contrast to the flat, minimalist design that is common today. Everything here, from the colors to the glassy buttons, was designed to evoke that specific feeling of early digital wonder.</p>
