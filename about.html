                    <p>Hello! My name is Diego, and this website is my personal space on the internet. I am passionate about technology, plate tectonics, design, horticulture, and exploring the web.</p>
                    <p>Here, you'll find a collection of my thoughts, projects, and things I find interesting. I was heavily inspired by the optimistic and nostalgic aesthetic of the mid-2000s, and I wanted to recreate that feeling here.</p>

                    <p>This website was created to showcase my interests and projects. It features a design style known as Frutiger Aero, which was popular in the mid-2000s to early 2010s. This style is characterized by glassy, transparent interfaces, glossy buttons, bright colors, and images of nature.</p>
                    <p>I wanted to create a space that feels welcoming and optimistic, reflecting my personality and interests. I hope you enjoy exploring the site!</p>
